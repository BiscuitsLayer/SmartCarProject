Engine Demo:

[] Prepare cube and cube_ebo <- so they look cool
and make different shaders/shader programs for them
[x] Move shader program into shader handler

Workflow:

[] Move code to CPP files to fasten engine build
[] Copy by value -> pass by const reference
[] Model names and info in ImGui (+ fix models[0] hardcode for car model)
[x] Configs based on JSONs
[x] Deal with Assimp DLL linkage
[x] Get rid of Assimp unit test linkage
[x] OOGL make call from CMakeLists.txt

Graphics:

[] PBR for car model
[x] First person camera
[] Free camera
[] Fix lines in AABB
[x] Wheels rotation

Bugs:

[] Texture unit for cubemap
[] Texture naming (autogen headers for GLSL)
[] Max FPS problem
