[x] Deal with Assimp DLL linkage
[x] Get rid of Assimp unit test linkage
[] OOGL make call via CMakeLists.txt

Graphics:

[] PBR for car model
[x] Wheels rotation

Bugs:

[] Texture unit for cubemap
[] Texture naming (autogen headers for GLSL)
[] Max FPS problem

Optional:

[] TinyGLTF loader (optional)
[] Atlas for textures (optional)
